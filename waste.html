Anyways, I will be working on a new version of waste.html, but it will be a while before the public release of waste2.html for Rambong Strief. If you are still here, I am writing a story called "The Old Ones". It will be full of new creatures and plenty of suspensful moments. I hope you enjoy it when it comes out. -EEEEEE74';
